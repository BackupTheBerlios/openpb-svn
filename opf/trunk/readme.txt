     Open Power Forms v. 1.0.0-dev readme
     Professional form support for OPT template engine
     
1. PROJECT INFORMATION

Open Power Forms is the first official add-on to the Open Power Template library. It provides
complex and well-featured HTML form support integrated with data validation system, AJAX and
user info collector.

2. REQUIREMENTS

Open Power Forms requires at least PHP 5.1.0 and the template engine Open Power Template 1.1.0
in order to work. Moreover, if you want to use the JavaScript code, you have to use an external
AJAX/DOM library to send and display results. 

3. VERSION INFORMATION

This is a development version of Open Power Forms library. Some of the features are not
implemented yet or they will be rewritten in the future. However, the PHP part has been
already used in various real projects and it is quite well tested. The JavaScript part
is heavily experimental and WE DO NOT RECOMMEND to use it in true applications!
